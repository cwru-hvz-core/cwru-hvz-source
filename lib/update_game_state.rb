#TODO: This file should contain the logic to, at any point,
# determine based on the database state, precisely who is
# human, zombie, and deceased. This script should also calculate
# point totals.
#
# Note: This file is responsible for being the correct
# judge of the current state. This file should update the following
# 'caches' of the current state -- so it can be easily
# accessed elsewhere:
#   registration.faction_id
#   registration.score
#
# Also, this file should store the current game state in the database
# if it has changed -- so all changes can be tracked over time.
